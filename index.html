      <h2>About Bear</h2>
      <p>
        Howdy, the name's Bear. I'm a full-stack web developer recently
        graduated and earned a Certificate from the Ohio State University
        Digital Bootcamp. I have skill with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, and
        more, and my background in factory and food service work gives me a
        well-honed talent for working efficiently with a team-first mindset. A
        hobbyist coder and resident tech expert since I was a child, I have a
        knack for teaching myself the necessary skills to solve a problem. I set
        up my first Apache server in my living room at the age of 13, and ever
        since I have wanted to make the internet a place where everyone has a
        home. When designing an application, user comfort and enjoyment is my
        top priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I can be found weightlifting, home brewing beers
        and ciders, or driving houseplants to suicide under the guise of
        gardening.
